# Stuff to implement
* cleanly implement the iteration using flatmaps. then, see if that can be done in a recursive-parallel fashion (if not, have fun with scala oneliners)
* Do a flexible and modular system for storing and representing systems. (maybe parsing from string, json, ...?) 
* Support more general l-systems. I think my implementation currently covers exclusively the simplest case -> context-dependant and non-deterministic
* expose more drawing options (fine grained color, width), and be smarter about scale, and canvas dimensions.
* 3D!!!!!
* create cool l-systems myself
