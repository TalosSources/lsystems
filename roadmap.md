# Stuff to implement
* Push/Pop stack for the turtle drawer (allows more expressive systems to be drawn. (turing complete?))
* Do a flexible and modular system for storing and representing systems. 
* Support more general l-systems. I think my implementation currently covers exclusively the simplest case
* expose more drawing options (fine grained color, width), and be smarter about scale, and canvas dimensions.
* 3D!!!!!
